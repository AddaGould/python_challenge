# python_challenge

During the python challenge, I recieved help from Siphe on the PyBank section and on both PyBank and PyPoll I ran my code through ChatGPT and asked it to help trouble shoot. The lines where I used code they provided are marked on the individual python files and are as follows:

In PyBank Siphe helped me with establishing code to iterate through the csv file and save values under previous and current profi (lines 20 to 23)
ChatGPT finessed the code I was using to find the greatest increase/decrease in profit (lines 26 to 32)
In PyPoll, ChatGPT helped again with finding the candidate with the most votes (the "winner") and suggested setting up the candidate_stats library. I also used the code it provided to call that data to print.
In both files, I looked to stackoverflow for instructions to print the results to a txt file.
